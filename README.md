# My Python Learning

This repository contains beginner-level Python programs I wrote while learning Python. Each file covers different core topics such as strings, variables, conditionals, and type conversions.

## Files and Descriptions

- **Name_Formatting_and_Slicing.py**  
  Combines and formats names using string slicing, f-strings, and length functions.

- **College_String_Methods_Demo.py**  
  Demonstrates Python string methods such as `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.find()`, `.replace()`, and more ‚Äî all applied on a college-related string.

- **Input_Type_Conversion_Math.py**  
  Takes user input as a string, converts it to integer, and performs arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, cube, etc.).

- **Variable_String_Lengths.py**  
  Defines and measures the length of strings representing roles. Also shows string slicing from different index ranges.

- **Chemical_Properties_Checker.py**  
  A mini program using dictionaries and conditional statements. Enter a chemical's name to view multiple properties (e.g., gas, acid, base, color-related, etc.).
